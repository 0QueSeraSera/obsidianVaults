### 1st thought:
thoughts: set a global maximum. traverse each node. For each node, the longest path that goes through it, must be the sum of the height of its left sub and right sub.
**critical**: Each node's longest path is its max sub height *+ the ancestors*
**How to record the ancestor's length?**

### 2nd:
wrong previously. simply add up the depth of the left and right sub tree.
