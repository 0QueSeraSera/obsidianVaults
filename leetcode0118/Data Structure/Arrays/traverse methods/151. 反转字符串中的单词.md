A very good practice on string operations
# Use lib functions

`str.join()` takes a list or tuple of strings and concatenate them. `str` is the _content used to connect_ each string
i.e, to connect words with space, use `" ".join(words_list)`

`str.split()` takes the content to split, `' '` and `', '` are commonly used

# Implementation from scratch
Python string is immutable, while C++ can be altered
