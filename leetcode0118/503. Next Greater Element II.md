#mono-stack #array_looping
First try failed to figure out the looping relationship

## mono-stack
should be a decreasing one. when meeting a bigger element, gets answer immediately
However, without _looping the array_, this case cannot be solved

## loopng the array
Instead, view the array as this

#note the index here seems tricky, use **_modolu_**
```
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        ret = [-1] * n
        stk = list()
        for i in range(n * 2 - 1):
            while stk and nums[stk[-1]] < nums[i % n]:
                ret[stk.pop()] = nums[i % n]
            stk.append(i % n)
        return ret
```
_range_ up to _2n-1_
the _top_ is still stk[-1]
looping with _**i % n**_, where i is [0,2n-1)

like {1, 2, 1}
i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
i%n = 0, 1, 2, 0, 1
