## Backtracking
Firstly, thought about backtracking:

This exceeds time limit
#note Backtracking is able to record the path. But it is not necessary here
## Memoization

## DP
#note there are two key factors that affects the result, thus, DP array is 2D
The hard part is that to calculate each **_status_**, needs to sum over other locations
**making it a triple loop**
_Initialization_, _traverse order_ are not easy to figure out.
#note we know that fuel gets less and less, to determine dp_i_j, fuel goes to smaller places.
