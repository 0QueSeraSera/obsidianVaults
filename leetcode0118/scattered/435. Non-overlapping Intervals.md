## DP Approach
O(n2) DP approach, the key is to set dp_i as the longest non-overlapping chain's count, ``rather than the maximum count that requires deleting``
This O(n2) method exceeds time limit
**can be optimized to O(nlogn) like 300.**

## Greedy
Still, it is about the **right bound**. this has a strong relation to [[300. Longest Increasing Subsequence]]

A truly neet solution
