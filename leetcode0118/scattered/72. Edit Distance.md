#DP #chanlleging #classic 
# 1. Analyze
Firstly,  2 arrays, think of dual pointers
#note when dealing DP with 2 strings, normally let `i` and `j` popint to the **tail** of each string and move **forward**
Not hard to see 4 patterns:
- s1_i == s2_j
- s1_i != s2_j
	- insert
	- delete
	- replace
**How to deal with the pointer movement?**
if equal: both move forward
insert: i remains, j--
delete: j remains, i--
replace: i--, j--
**When to return?** 
when i or j becomes -1 (traversed over an entire string)
**what to return?**( **_tricky_**)
for another string, delete the remaining value

# 2. Recursion
The recursion implementation
exceeds time limit

# 3. DP
**How to optimize with DP?**
DP saves time by _storing the result of 3 operations_
Instead of calling recursively each time, use DP table to judge

DP meaning: target value (minimum edition distance) of `s1_0~s1_i` and `s2_0~s2_j`
