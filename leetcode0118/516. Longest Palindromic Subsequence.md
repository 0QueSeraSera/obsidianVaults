DP key steps:
- _**Status variables**_: what are the factors that affects the result
- DP array meaning
- transimission functions
Implementation detail:
- traverse order: 

Here the _**status variables**_ are left and right boundaris. 
Because we can arbitrarily remove elements, `dp_i_j` can derive from `dp_i+1_j-1` 
Judge `s_i` and `s_j`. 
- If equal, then `dp_i_j` add **2** `dp_i+1_j-1` 
- else, inherite the maximum of `dp_i+1_j` and `dp_i_j-1` #chanlleging
