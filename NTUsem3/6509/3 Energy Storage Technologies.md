### Lead Acid
![[Pasted image 20230916122504.png]]
#### large format versions
- improve capacity
- reduce maintenance
known as **deep cycling batteries**, **valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA)**
- VRLA needs less maintenance but _valve regulation_.

# Health monitoring of Li-ion batteries
## Operation process
### Charge process
![[Pasted image 20230916235320.png]]
1. V rises at const I
2. V peaks, I drops
3. charging stops
4. occasional topping charge

### Health indicator (HI)
As the charging times _increases_, the **time duration** between the same voltage interval is _decreasing_. "The more usage, the faster it charges"
