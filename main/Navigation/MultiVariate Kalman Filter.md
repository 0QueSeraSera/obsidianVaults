# Overview
A general procedure of the Bayesian Filter and its variances:

Key factors: 
- **state variables**: specify what is the observed data
- **process model**: to predict the future states
- **measurement**: to measure the state variables
What a filter does:
Compute a Gain to add up _weighted_ measurement and prediction

Note that different from #state_space_model , the filter also **updates states' covariances**

The final estimation that blends _measurement_ and _prediction_ is the same form:
```
x = x_pred + K Â· (x_measure - x_pred)
```
