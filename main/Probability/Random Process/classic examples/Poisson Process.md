[[Random Process]]

possion process is a time-indexed series of possion distribution r.v [[Poisson distribution]]
while Possion distribution: X~P(*lambda*), *lambda* denotes the **cnt** of certain event (**random, independent**) happens,
given a time period of *tau* , the **cnt** of events happens in this *tau* is P(*lambda* *tau* )

the **time interval** between 2 consectively happened event T, 
T~EXP(*lambda*) [[exponential distribution]]

Possion r.v can be divided and merged, so as the Possion Process
