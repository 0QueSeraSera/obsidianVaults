# methods for mapping G(s) to G_D(z)
==remember s and z mapping in the first 3 methods==
## backward difference
==s=(z-1)/Tz==

### intuitive understanding

Bilinear trans is an 1st order approximation of exp(sT), which is z
## pole-zero matching
#6203_recite 
==take every pole and zero in the S domain==
==and move them to Z domain==
==**z = exp(sT)**==

in step 2, the additional zeros count equals to:
`num of finite poles - num of finite zeros - 1`
with `-1`, step 3 is included
step 4, calculate DC gain alpha with:
`G_D(z)|z=1 = G(s)|s=0`

## summary and memorizaiton
backward: s = (z-1)/Tz
forward: s = (z-1)/T
	_backward is one **z** more in the D, thus dragging it back_
bilinear:
bi, thus has z and 1 in both N and D
s = (2/T) Â· (z-1)/(z+1)
	-1 is smaller than 1, compensate with 2 and T respectively
	**(z-1) as N is universal**
pole-zero matching
#6203_recite 
_(z+1)^(n-m-1) here is unique_
**(z+1), not (z-1)**
_directly convert roots in S to Z with s = exp(sT)_

s-pole --> z-poles; s-zeros --> z-zeros
key: ==s-->exp(sT)==
z=exp(sT), s = 1/T * ln(z)
