adding feedback to the system will change the dynamics, 
but can be turned into open-loop form

[[Nyquist plot]], [[Bode plot]], [[Routh-Hurwitz]], [[root locus]] can be applied to **open-loop** systems

# So, how to determine stability of open-loop system??

look at the roots of G(s)

# what about close-loop system??

# how to design controller H to meet certain criteria?
