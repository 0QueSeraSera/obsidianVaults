## choose parent
- generate a spherical region (**neighbourhood**) centered at the new sp 
- in the neighbourhood, select the node with **minimal sum of distances** to start and to the sp. Like A-Star
## rewire
- after connecting the new sp, **update** the neighbourhood nodes with better paths to the start

# Contribution
- when sampling approaches infinity, an **optimal** path is guaranteed
