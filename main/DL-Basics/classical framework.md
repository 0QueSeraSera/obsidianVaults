[[Object Detection]]
****
Object detection neural networks are a type of deep learning model used to locate and classify objects within an image or video. There are several classical object detection neural networks that have been developed over the years. Here are a few examples:

1.  R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network): R-CNN was one of the first successful object detection models. It operates by selecting regions of interest in an image and then classifying them using a CNN.
    
2.  Fast R-CNN: This model builds on R-CNN by improving the speed and accuracy of the region proposal process. It does this by using a single CNN to extract features from the entire image, and then using those features to generate region proposals.
    
3.  Faster R-CNN: This is an extension of Fast R-CNN that adds a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to the model. The RPN generates region proposals directly from the CNN feature map, resulting in even faster and more accurate object detection.
    
4.  YOLO (You Only Look Once): YOLO is a popular object detection model that processes an entire image in one pass and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for all objects in the image simultaneously. This makes it very fast and efficient.
    
5.  SSD (Single Shot Detector): SSD is another single-pass object detection model that uses a multi-scale feature extraction network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities at different scales. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.
