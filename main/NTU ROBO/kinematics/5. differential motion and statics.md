# Tool Configuration Jacobian Matrix
direct kinematics equation: `x = w(q)`
`x(t)`: tool-configuration trajectory
`q(t)`: joint space trajectory

Other than IK, use **tool-configuration Jacobian Matrix**

`V_jk(q) = d(w_k(q))/d(q_j)`

`V(q)` forms `x. = V(q)q.` joint-space <--> tool-config space
## Example
![[Pasted image 20230422155600.png]]
To acquire V(q), take derivatives of w(q) to each q respectively
Here, q1 ~ q5
`v1(q) = d{w(q)}/d{q1}`

# Resolved-Motion Rate Control
For n <=6, use pseudo inverse can solve `q.`

Eventually, motion in *tool-config* is resolved into *joint-space* component
Essentially the same with IK
