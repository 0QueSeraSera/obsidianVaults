# Pick and Place
point-to-point motion control consists of 4 points
1. pick point: initial position and orientation

2. Lift-off point: 
	_orientation_ is the same with **pick point**
	_position_ is a distance backward along the approach vector

# Continuous path motion
a path is pure spatial. add temporal info to it and it becomes trajectory
