### Explicit approaches
#### Fitness Sharing

#### Crowding
#### Speciation
divide individuals into different species. Mating only takes places in similar species

### Implicit approaches
#### Island model EA
Simultaneously run multiple populations

Select some individuals and **exhange their population**: _migration_
#### Cellular EA
