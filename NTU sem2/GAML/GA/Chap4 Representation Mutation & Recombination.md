### variation operations
![[Pasted image 20230219224409.png]]
In mutation, each gene is altered with **mutation rate** _independently_

### Other recombination 
Problems with 1-point crossover
![[Pasted image 20230219224631.png]]
#### n-point crossover
![[Pasted image 20230219224720.png]]
#### Uniform crossover
![[Pasted image 20230219225033.png]]
- bitwise independent
- equal chance of inheriting from 2 parents
- inverse another child

### choice between mutation and recombination
![[Pasted image 20230219225146.png]]
note that recombination makes larger difference, hence explorative

## Integer
### Summary
Suits cases with natrual integer variables or categorical values
