Each _manipulated variable_ depends on 2 or more _controlled variables_
# Transfer Function Matrix G_p(s)
## 2x2 system example

2 output, 2 input, forms 4 variations
To derive y1 and y2, **sum multiple inputs effect up**

Turn them into vector from:

# Control loop Interactions
## 2x2 system illustration
1-1/2-2 controller paring

and 1-2/2-1 controller pairing

### Hidden closed-loop
The 3rd closed loop is present. This may destablize the system and make tuning more difficult

## Block Diagram Analysis
**Discuss when when the other feedback loop is open or close**
Given this 1-1/2-2 paring:
![[Pasted image 20230223234635.png]]
There are 2 cases for transfer function
The second _Involves G_c2_
